I am a PhD student in Computational Mechanics in the research group of [Prof. Schillinger](https://www.ibnm.uni-hannover.de/de/schillinger/) at the Institute of Mechanics and Computational Mechanics (IBNM) at Leibniz Universität Hannover, Germany. I have a background with M. Sc. in Engineering Science from Technische Universität Berlin specialised in Solid Mechanics and Simulation Based Engineering. I also hold a B. Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from Technische Universität Berlin.


My research interests
======
My reseach interests and focus are on numerical methods such as nonlinear finite element methods (NFEM) in the context of finite growth theory, immersed finite element methods, multiscale modeling and computational methods for biomedical problems (human liver). Currently, I am working on a novel approach for the computational modeling of growth using a level set and immersed boundary method. This new method does not need any remeshing and can be applied to very complex geometries like the human liver in an immersed boundary framework as our approach is compatible with imaging data.
