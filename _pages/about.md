I am a PhD student in Computational Mechanics in the research group of [Prof. Schillinger](https://www.ibnm.uni-hannover.de/de/schillinger/) at the Institute of Mechanics and Computational Mechanics (IBNM) at Leibniz Universit√§t Hannover, Germany. I have a background in M. Sc. in Engineering Science from Berlin Institute of Technology (TU Berlin) specialised in Solid Mechanics and Simulation Based Engineering. I also hold a B. Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from TU Berlin.


My research interests
======
My research interests and focus lie on numerical methods such as nonlinear finite element methods (NFEM) in the context of finite growth theory, immersed finite element methods, multiscale modeling and computational methods for biomedical problems (human liver). Currently, I am working on a novel approach for the computational modeling of growth using a level set and immersed boundary method. The new method does not need any remeshing and can be applied to very complex geometries like the human liver in an immersed boundary framework as our approach is compatible with imaging data.
